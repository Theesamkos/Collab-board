# token-optimizer configuration
# ---------------------------------
# Copy this file and adjust as needed.  All values are optional — defaults
# are shown.  The CLI and TokenTracker read these at startup.

project:
  name: "collab-board"          # Default project tag for log_usage()
  team_member: "Samuel Orth"    # Default team-member tag

routing:
  # Complexity thresholds that determine which Claude model is selected.
  # See model_router.py for the full scoring logic.
  haiku_max_score: 30           # 0–30  → haiku
  sonnet_max_score: 70          # 31–70 → sonnet
  # 71–100 → opus (no separate key needed)

  # When the complexity score is at or above this value the router marks the
  # output for validation (should_validate: true).
  validate_threshold: 60

quality:
  # validate_output() returns 'pass' / 'warning' / 'fail' based on these.
  pass_threshold: 60
  escalate_threshold: 55        # score below this → should_escalate_to_opus

logging:
  # Path to the append-only usage log.  Relative paths are resolved from the
  # token-optimizer/ directory.  Override with the USAGE_LOG env variable.
  log_path: "usage_log.json"

models:
  # Canonical model IDs used by ModelRouter.  Update when Anthropic releases
  # new versions.
  haiku:  "claude-haiku-4-5-20251001"
  sonnet: "claude-sonnet-4-6"
  opus:   "claude-opus-4-6"
